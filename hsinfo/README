Test steps:
1. run rundb.sh under students/DynamoDB
2. python manage.py runserver

students module:
	Note: To test DynamoDB, rundb.sh must be executed before all the tests

	create_table.py:
		create table if it is not created
	load_table.py:
		load bulk data from studentsdata.json
	dump_table.py:
		dump data from DynamoDB to dumptable.json which can be used to overwrite studentsdata.json
	delete_table.py:
		delete table. Useful for starting over
	config.py:
		used to load config, connect to database, and get table based on config.json
	config.json:
		configurations of the database. Try to move and read all the config from config.json
		a file under the project root directory is linked to the config.json, since it seems necessary to have a copy under the root
		I am not sure if the soft link works if it is checked out on other machines.
		if it does not work, please hard copy the config.json under students to the project root directory (hsinfo)
	add_item.py:
	get_item.py:
	update_item.py:
	delete_item.py:
		APIs to access database and get DynamoDB response

TODO:
1. according to Prof, first name and last name have to be secondary keys

Note:
1. Per Prof, partitioning in this project is not required, so I didn't do it
